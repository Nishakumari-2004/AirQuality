🌍 Air Quality and Meteorological Variables Report

📑 Introduction

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) collaborates with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international bodies to establish guidelines for air quality. These guidelines define permissible concentration levels for pollutants such as:

PM2.5 (µg/m³)
PM10 (µg/m³)
NO (µg/m³)
NO₂ (µg/m³)
NH₃ (µg/m³)
SO₂ (µg/m³)
CO (mg/m³)
Ozone (µg/m³)
MP-Xylene (µg/m³)
AT (°C)
RH (%)
NOx (ppb)


🧪 Pollutant-Wise Analysis

1.PM2.5 (Particulate Matter < 2.5 µm)
WHO Guidelines:
Annual Mean: 5 µg/m³
24-Hour Mean: 15 µg/m³
Dataset Average: 35.21 µg/m³

✅ Observation: Higher than WHO standard → indicates significant health risks.

2.PM10 (Particulate Matter < 10 µm)
WHO Guidelines:
Annual Mean: 15 µg/m³
24-Hour Mean: 45 µg/m³
Dataset Average: 63.6 µg/m³

✅ Observation: Higher than WHO standard.

3.NO₂ (Nitrogen Dioxide)
WHO Guidelines:
Annual Mean: 10 µg/m³
1-Hour Mean: 200 µg/m³
Dataset Average: 6–10 µg/m³

✅ Observation: Around the upper threshold, potentially exceeding WHO guidelines.

4.NH₃ (Ammonia)
WHO does not specify ambient guidelines.
OSHA PEL (Workplace Standard): 50 ppm (8-hour exposure).

5.SO₂ (Sulfur Dioxide)
WHO Guidelines:
10-Minute Mean: 500 µg/m³
24-Hour Mean: 20 µg/m³
Dataset Average: 6.3–10 µg/m³

✅ Observation: Lower than WHO standard.

6.CO (Carbon Monoxide)
WHO Guidelines:
1-Hour Mean: 30 mg/m³ (26 ppm)
8-Hour Mean: 10 mg/m³ (9 ppm)
Dataset Average: 0.7–1 mg/m³

✅ Observation: Lower than WHO standard.

7.Ozone (O₃)
WHO Guidelines:
8-Hour Mean: 100 µg/m³ (50 ppb)
Dataset Average: 7–20 µg/m³

✅ Observation: Lower than WHO standard.

8.Xylene
WHO Guidelines: Not explicitly defined.
EPA NAAQS Standard: 0.53 ppm (2000 µg/m³ annual mean).
Dataset Average: 3.50 µg/m³

✅ Observation: Well below permissible levels.


📌 Information on PM2.5
Health Risk: PM2.5 poses the highest threat due to deep penetration into the lungs.

Global Impact:
4.2 million deaths annually attributed to PM2.5 exposure.
100+ million DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) in 2015.
India: PM2.5 is the 3rd leading health risk factor.

📊 Seasonal & Temporal Trends

Reports & Literature Insights
Winter → Most polluted due to household emissions & lower boundary layers.
Monsoon → Lowest pollution due to wet scavenging by rainfall.

Diurnal Trends:
Morning & evening peaks observed in Hyderabad & Chennai.
In other cities, evening peaks lasted longer.

Sources of PM2.5
Inorganic ions: NH₄⁺, NO₃⁻, SO₄²⁻
Carbonaceous compounds
Mineral dust

PM10 Characteristics
Derived from:
Combustion (gasoline, diesel, wood, oil)
Construction dust, agriculture, landfills
Wildfires & industrial emissions
Pollen & bacteria fragments

Deposition:
PM2.5 → deeper lung regions
PM10 → upper airways

🔍 Observations
General Trends
Winter (Jan–Mar) → Peak concentrations of both PM2.5 & PM10.
Monsoon → Lowest PM2.5 values.
Oct–Dec → Lowest PM10 values.

Time-Series Insights
Rainfall peaks in September, correlating with lower PM2.5.
February shows high PM2.5 due to negligible rainfall.
Rainfall reduces PM2.5 via wet deposition.
Dry periods → Accumulation of PM2.5 → higher concentrations.

✅ Conclusion
PM2.5 & PM10 consistently exceed WHO standards, highlighting major air quality challenges.
Rainfall acts as a natural scrubber, lowering PM2.5 levels during monsoon.
Seasonal and diurnal variations reveal patterns essential for predictive modeling and policy formulation.
