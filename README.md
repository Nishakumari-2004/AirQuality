# 🌏 Air Quality & Meteorological Data Analysis at IITH

A data-driven project analyzing **meteorological factors and air quality compliance** at IIT Hyderabad using datasets from the **Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)**.  
The project investigates how weather parameters (rainfall, temperature, humidity, etc.) impact air pollutants like **PM2.5** and **PM10**, and benchmarks results against **WHO air quality standards**.

## ✨ Features

- 📥 **Data Collection**  
  - Scraped & compiled meteorological and air quality data from CPCB.  
  - Managed missing values and anomalies in long-term data series.  

- 🧹 **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
  - Data cleaning, normalization, and feature scaling.  
  - Handling seasonal trends and anomaly detection.  

- 📊 **Data Visualization & Analysis**  
  - Histograms, scatter plots, and time-series analysis of PM concentrations.  
  - Trend comparison with meteorological factors (temperature, rainfall, humidity).  

- 🤖 **Model Development**  
  - Built **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** models to predict PM2.5/PM10 levels from meteorological variables.  
  - Benchmarked model predictions against **WHO air quality thresholds**.  

- 📈 **Results**  
  - Identified strong correlation between **seasonal weather patterns** and pollutant concentrations.  
  - ANN-based models provided high accuracy for pollution forecasting.
