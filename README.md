Meteorological Data Analysis and Air Quality Compliance Modeling at IITH:

Data Collection and Preparation: Collected meteorological data of IITH from the CPCB website, implemented data preprocessing, and feature engineering.
Data Visualization and Analysis: Used histograms to understand and compare variables, and analyzed the data.
Model Development and Evaluation: Developed a neural network model to compare meteorological variables (rainfall, temperature, etc.) with PM2.5 and PM10 levels exceeding WMO/WHO standards, and evaluated its performance.
Reporting: Prepared a report on PM2.5 and PM10 sources, their seasonal concentration changes with rainfall, and trend analysis.
